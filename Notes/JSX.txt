->jsx stands for javascript extension syntax .
->It lets us write html directly inside JS .
->jsx is not fully javascript code , for that we use transpile jsx , and babel do the transpile for converting jsx to javascript . and its not seen by us that is done by automatically .
-> the first rule is we can return only one single root element that's why we create div and all thing put in there .
->in jsx always have to be closing tag .for doing conversion clearly by pabble .
