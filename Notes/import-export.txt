import : import Title from "./Title.jsx";
export : export default Title;

second way 
import {Title} from "//Title.jsx";
export {Title};

Note :-
In summary , name exports are useful when you want to export multiple values and import them with their specific name , while default exports are handy for exporting a single value and giving it a custom name when importing . The choice between the two depends on the structure and requirement of your codebase .

-> with the help of webPack we can import and export the things .
